As an engineer, I am constantly in need of embedding spreadsheet functionality into my applications. QtCalcStar is intended to provide the user a Microsoft Excel equivalent spreadsheet control and function evaluator. The function evaluator used in this library is derived from the CalcStar engine. The function set covers most of the major Excel math functions that operate on either individual cells or a range of cells. The functions provided are as given below.
